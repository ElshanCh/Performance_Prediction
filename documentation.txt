Topic: Hourly Forecasting of Number of Messages and Anomaly Classification.

- OS used for development: UBUNTU

As clear from the topic there are two Model in this project:
- Hourly Forecasting of Number of Messages
- Anomaly Classification

1. Hourly Forecasting of Number of Messages(NMSG).

- The idea of the model: To develop model with NeuralProphet algorithm that will be able to predict 
the number of messages coming to the servers based on the historical data 

- The Data is taken from the S3 production "Performance" bucket. This data is stored in "/Data/train_data/".

- For this model there has been developed the POC first in the "notebooks/NeuralProphet_NMSG_testing.ipynb" file.
And then has been modulized into the "src" folder.

!!! Please notice that when you first time run requirements.txt uncomment the "-e ."  in the requirements.txt will trigger the setup.py. 
After that you may comment it. It will let you to use python modul from different location.

- Structure of the "src" folder:
Here you may found two Folders ("components", "pipelines") and some additional python files.
In the "components" folder as the name states there are defined components that get called 
in specific pipelines of the "pipelines" folder, thus our main attention will be
on the pipelines.

- "src\pipelines" folder:
"1.ETL_pipeline.py" is used for to export-transform-load the data for the model
"2.Hyperparam_tuning.py" is used to perform hyperparameter tuning in order to find the best model.
At this stage the MlFow has been used to track the trained models. 
"3.Predict_pipeline.py" is used to predict on the model chosen from the output of the Huperparameter tuning.

2. Anomaly Classification.

- The idea of the model: To develop model an anomaly detection model that takes last 24 hours Performance data and predicts the anomaly based on historical pattern.
There has been used a LSTM RNN model on timeseries.

This model is in POC stage. It is Located in the following notebooks:
- notebooks/LSTM_Classification_data_preparation.ipynb :  in this notebook you find the data preprocessing stage.
- notebooks/LSTM_Classification_model.ipynb : basically the model itself.
